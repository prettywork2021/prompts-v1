    # This is a list of one-liners for the linux command-line:
    
    # get newest file in directory bash:
    ls -t * | head -1

    # Find with invert match - e.g. find every file that is not mp3:
    find . -name '*' -type f -not -path '*.mp3'

    # Recursively remove all "node_modules" folders:
    find . -name "node_modules" -exec rm -rf '{}' +
