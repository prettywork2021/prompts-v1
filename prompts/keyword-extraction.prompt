    GPT-3 showed that language can be used to instruct a large neural network
    to perform a variety of text generation tasks. Image GPT showed that the
    same type of neural network can also be used to generate images with high
    fidelity. We extend these findings to show that manipulating visual
    concepts through language is now within reach.
# A preprocessor filters the var at that position
# This may be useful to distinguish a block of text, for example
# preprocessors:
# - "cat"
# External provides an alternate script that performs the same function
