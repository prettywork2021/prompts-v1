    Men at Work are an Australian rock band formed
    in Melbourne in 1978 and best known for
    breakthrough hits such as "Who Can It Be Now?"
    or "Down Under". Its founding member and
    frontman is Colin Hay, who performs on lead
    vocals and guitar. After playing as an
    acoustic duo with Ron Strykert during 1978â€“79,
    Hay formed the group with Strykert playing
    bass guitar and Jerry Speiser on drums. They
    were soon joined by Greg Ham on flute,
    saxophone, and keyboards and John Rees on bass
    guitar, with Strykert then switching to lead
    guitar.
